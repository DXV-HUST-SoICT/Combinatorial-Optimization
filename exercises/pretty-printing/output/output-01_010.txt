Facebook
is an
American
online
social
media and
social
networking
service
based in
Menlo
Park,
California
and a
flagship
service
of the
namesake
company

Inc.
It was
founded
by Mark
Zuckerberg
-, along
with
fellow
Harvard
College
students
and
roommates
Eduardo
Saverin,
Andrew
McCollum,
Dustin
Moskovitz

The

initially
limited

to Harvard
students.

was
expanded
to Ivy
League
universiti
-es, MIT,
and higher
education
institutio
-ns in the
Boston
area, then
various
other
universiti
-es, and
lastly
high
school
students.
Since
2006,
anyone who
claims
to be at
least 13
years old
has been
allowed to
become a
registered
user of
Facebook,
though
this may
vary
depending
on local
laws. The
name comes
from the
face book
directorie
-s often
given to
American
university
students.

The
Facebook
service
can be
accessed
from
devices
with
Internet
connectivi
-ty,
such as
personal
computers,
tablets
and
smartphone
-s. After
registerin
-g, users
can create
a profile
revealing
informatio

themselves
-. They
can post
text,
photos and
multimedia
which is
shared
with any
other
users
that have
agreed to
be their
"friend",
or, with a
different
privacy
setting,
with any
reader.
Users can
also use
various
embedded
apps, join
common-int

groups,
buy and
sell
items or
services
on
Marketplac
-e, and
receive
notificati

their
Facebook
friends'
activities
and
activities
of
Facebook
pages they
follow.
Facebook
claimed
that it
had more
than 2.3
billion
monthly
active
users
as of
December
2018.

Facebook
has been
subject to
extensive
media
coverage
and many
controvers
-ies.
These
often
involve
user
privacy
(as with
the
Cambridge
Analytica
data
scandal),
political
manipulati
-on (as
with the
2016 U.S.
elections)
-,
psychologi
-cal
effects
such as
addiction
and low
self-estee
-m, and
content
that some
users find
objectiona
-ble,
including
fake news,
conspiracy
theories,
and
copyright
infringeme
-nt.
Commentato
-rs have
accused
Facebook
of helping
to spread
false
informatio
-n and
fake news.
In 2017,
Facebook
partnered
with fact
checkers
from the
Poynter
Institute'
-s
Internatio
-nal
Fact-Check
-ing
Network to
identify
and mark
false
content,
though
most ads
from
political
candidates
are exempt
from this
program.
Critics
of the
program
accuse
Facebook
of not
doing
enough to
remove
false
informatio
-n from
its
website.
Facebook
was the
most
downloaded
mobile
app of
the 2010s
globally.
