Facebook is an American online social media and social networking
service based in Menlo Park, California and a flagship service of the
namesake company Facebook, Inc. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg,
along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo
Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.

The founders initially limited Facebook membership to Harvard students.
Membership was expanded to Ivy League universities, MIT, and higher
education institutions in the Boston area, then various other universities,
and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be
at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of
Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws. The name comes from
the face book directories often given to American university students.

The Facebook service can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity,
such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering,
users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They
can post text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users
that have agreed to be their "friend", or, with a different privacy
setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join
common-interest groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace,
and receive notifications of their Facebook friends' activities and
activities of Facebook pages they follow. Facebook claimed that it
had more than 2.3 billion monthly active users as of December 2018.

Facebook has been subject to extensive media coverage and many controversies.
These often involve user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data
scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections),
psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and content
that some users find objectionable, including fake news, conspiracy
theories, and copyright infringement. Commentators have accused Facebook
of helping to spread false information and fake news. In 2017, Facebook
partnered with fact checkers from the Poynter Institute's International
Fact-Checking Network to identify and mark false content, though most ads from
political candidates are exempt from this program. Critics of the program
accuse Facebook of not doing enough to remove false information from its
website. Facebook was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s globally.
