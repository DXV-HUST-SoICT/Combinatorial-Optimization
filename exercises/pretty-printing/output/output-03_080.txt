Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or
/ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ee-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual
online encyclopedia created and maintained as an open collaboration
project by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing
system. It is the largest and most popular general reference work on
the World Wide Web, and is one of the most popular websites ranked
by Alexa as of January 2020. It features exclusively free content
and no commercial ads, and is owned and supported by the Wikimedia
Foundation, a non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.

Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.
Sanger coined its name, as a portmanteau of "wiki" (the Hawaiian word for
"quick") and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia,
versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed. With at
least 6,035,561 articles,[note 3] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the
more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than
40 million articles in 301 different languages and by February 2014 it had
reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month.

In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles
from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level
of accuracy approached that of Britannica, although critics suggested that
it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of
all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues.
The following year, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of
allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best
encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.

Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a
mixture of "truth, half truth, and some falsehoods", and for being subject
to manipulation and spin in controversial topics. Wikipedia has also been
criticized for gender bias, particularly on its English-language site, where the
dominant majority of editors are male. However, Edit-a-thons have been held to
encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics. Facebook
announced that by 2017 it would help readers detect fake news by suggesting
links to related Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.
