Instagram is an American
photo and video-sharing
social networking service
owned by Facebook,
Inc. It was created by
Kevin Systrom and Mike
Krieger, and launched
in October 2010 on iOS.
A version for Android
devices was released in
April 2012, followed
by a feature-limited
website interface in
November 2012, a Fire
OS app on June 15, 2014
and an app for Windows
10 tablets and computers
in October 2016. The app
allows users to upload
photos and videos, which
can be edited with
filters and organized
with tags and location
information. Posts can be
shared publicly or with
pre-approved followers.
Users can browse other
users' content by tags
and locations, and view
trending content. Users
can like photos and
follow other users to add
their content to a feed.

Instagram was originally
distinguished by only
allowing content to
be framed in a square
(1:1) aspect ratio with
640 pixels to match the
display width of the
iPhone at the time.
These restrictions were
eased in 2015, with an
increase to 1080 pixels.
The service also added
messaging features,
the ability to include
multiple images or videos
in a single post, as well
as "Stories"—similar
to its main competitor
Snapchat—which allows
users to post photos and
videos to a sequential
feed, with each post
accessible by others for
24 hours each. As of
January 2019, the Stories
feature is used by 500
million users daily.

After its launch in
2010, Instagram rapidly
gained popularity, with
one million registered
users in two months, 10
million in a year, and 1
billion as of May 2019.
In April 2012, Facebook
acquired the service
for approximately US$1
billion in cash and
stock. As of October
2015, over 40 billion
photos had been uploaded.
Although praised for its
influence, Instagram
has been the subject of
criticism, most notably
for policy and interface
changes, allegations of
censorship, and illegal
or improper content
uploaded by users.

As of March 2020, the
most followed person is
footballer Cristiano
Ronaldo with over 207
million followers, and
the most followed woman
is singer Ariana Grande
with over 177 million
followers. As of January
14, 2019, the most liked
photo on Instagram is
a picture of an egg,
posted by the account
@world_record_egg,
created with the sole
purpose of surpassing
the previous record of
18 million likes on a
Kylie Jenner post. The
picture currently has
over 54 million likes.
Instagram was the 4th
most downloaded mobile
app of the 2010s.
