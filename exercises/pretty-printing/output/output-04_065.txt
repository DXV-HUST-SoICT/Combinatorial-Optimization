Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald
Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I
personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12
days. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January
1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II,
grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired
a staff of computer designers and had a production line.
Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over
the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring
innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original
Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for
its products received widespread critical acclaim. However,
the high price of its products and limited application library
caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In
1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary
employee, while Jobs and others resigned to found NeXT.

As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved
through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced
duopoly of Microsoft Windows on Intel PC clones. The board
recruited CEO Gil Amelio to what would be a 500-day charge for
him to rehabilitate the financially troubled companyâ€”reshaping
it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus.
In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately
failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs
pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple
swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing Think
different campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching
the iMac in 1998, opening the retail chain of Apple Stores in
2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software
portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc.,
reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and
launched the iPhone to great critical acclaim and financial
success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health
complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later,
Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June
2019, Jony Ive, Apple's CDO, left the company to start his own
firm, but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.

Apple is well known for its size and revenues. Its worldwide
annual revenue totaled $265 billion for the 2018 fiscal year.
Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue and
one of the world's most valuable companies. It is also the
world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung
and Huawei. In August 2018, Apple became the first public U.S.
company to be valued at over $1 trillion. The company employs
123,000 full-time employees and maintains 504 retail stores
in 24 countries as of 2018. It operates the iTunes Store,
which is the world's largest music retailer. As of January
2018, more than 1.3 billion Apple products are actively in
use worldwide. The company also has a high level of brand
loyalty and is ranked as the world's most valuable brand.
However, Apple receives significant criticism regarding the
labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices
and unethical business practices, including anti-competitive
behavior, as well as the origins of source materials.
